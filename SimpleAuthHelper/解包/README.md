Overview
--------

Very simple plugin that simplifies the login process... Instead of
asking for commands, users simply chat away...

### Register process

Player connects for the first time.  They are prompted to enter a
*NEW* password.  They enter their password directly, without having to
enter */register*.

They are asked for the password again to confirm.  They re-enter their
password (again without */register*).

### Login process

Player connects again.  They are prompted to enter their login
password.  They type their login password directly (without
*/login*).  And they are in.

Documentation
-------------

As a bonus, it can start a player with initial inventory upon
registration.  This is configured through the `nest-egg` setting.

### Commands

* *chpwd* _<old-pwd>_  
  Used by players to change their passwords.
* *resetpwd* _<player>_  
  Used by ops to reset a players password.  This actually unregisters
  the password.

### Configuration

	---
	messages:
	  re-enter pwd: 'Please re-enter password to confirm:'
	  passwords dont match: |-
	    Passwords do not match.
	    Please try again!
	    Enter a new password:
	  register ok: You have been registered!
	  no spaces: |-
	    Password should not contain spaces
	    or tabs
	  not name: Password should not be your name
	  too many login: You have attempted to login too many times.
	  login timeout: Login timer expired!
	nest-egg:
	- "272:0:1"
	- "17:0:16"
	- "364:0:5"
	- "266:0:10"
	max-attempts: 5
	login-timeout: 60
	auto-ban: false
	...

* The section `messages` can be used to configure displayed texts.
* `nest-egg` section contains list of items that will be given to the
player upon registration.
* `max-attempts` counts the number of tries to login.
* `login-timeout` will kick the player out if not authenticated in
  that number of seconds.
* `auto-ban`: If set to true it will automatically ban the IP of a
  player that does too many login attempts.
